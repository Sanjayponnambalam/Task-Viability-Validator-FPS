# Task-Viability-Validator-FPS
Task Viability in Fixed Priority Scheduling under Real time Multi - Processor Environments. 

# Task manager
- A validation system which identifies those tasks which are not feasible under Fixed Priority Scheduling (FPS).
- An Infeasibility test is performed on a set of real time tasks through which we can easily halt that particular task and give other task more priority for faster computation.
